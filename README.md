# FFT-vs-Goertzel-Dominant-Frequency-Detection
This project compares Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Goertzel algorithm for dominant frequency detection on smartphone notification audio. Real audio recordings are analyzed to evaluate accuracy, computational efficiency, and stability on single-tone and multi-tone signals for real-time and embedded applications.
